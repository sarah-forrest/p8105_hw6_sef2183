# Problem 1

Download the 2017 Central Park weather data using code adapted from the
course website:

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the
predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data:

r̂ 2 log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1)

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for r̂ 2 and log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1). Note: broom::glance() is
helpful for extracting r̂ 2 from a fitted regression, and broom::tidy()
(with some additional wrangling) should help in computing log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1).

# Problem 2

The code below reads in the Washington Post’s homicide data on homicides
in 50 large U.S. cities. Then, a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore,
MD”) and a binary variable `homicide_resolved` indicating whether the
homicide is solved (“Yes” or “No”) are created. Dallas, TX, Phoenix, AZ,
and Kansas City, MO are omitted from the dataframe as these cities don’t
report victim race. Tulsa, AL is also omitted from the dataframe due to
a data entry mistake. Finally, the dataframe is limited to homicides for
whom `victim_race` is white or black and the `victim_age` variable is
converted to numeric:

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    homicide_resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ",
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL",
         victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion
```

## Logistic Regression Output for Baltimore, MD

The code below uses the `glm()` function to fit a logistic regression
with resolved vs. unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race
as predictors for the city of Baltimore, MD. The output of this
regression saved as an R object called `fit_logistic`.

``` r
fit_logistic =
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  glm(homicide_resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())
```

The code below obtains the estimate and confidence interval of the
adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to
female victims keeping all other variables fixed:

``` r
fit_logistic %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - (1.96 * std.error)),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + (1.96 * std.error))) %>%
  select(term, OR, CI_lower, CI_upper) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| term           |   OR | CI_lower | CI_upper |
|:---------------|-----:|---------:|---------:|
| victim_sexMale | 0.43 |     0.32 |     0.56 |

## Logistic Regression Output for All Cities

The code below creates a nested dataframe `homicide_nest_df` that
contains data on whether each homicide is resolved, as well as victim
demographic information for each city in the dataset. Then, a function
called “glm_OR_CI” is created that takes in a dataframe and applies the
`glm()` function to run a logistic regression model with resolved vs
unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors and
calculate the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds
ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
keeping all other variables fixed. This function is called and mapped to
a new `glm_output` variable which is then unnested and assigned to a new
`homicide_glm_df` dataframe. The `homicide_glm_df` dataframe contains 5
variables: `city_state`, a `data` variable containing a tibble with the
victim and homicide data used in the logistic regression model, `OR`,
and the lower and upper confidence interval values `CI_lower` and
`CI_upper`:

``` r
homicide_nest_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, homicide_resolved, victim_race:victim_sex) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest(data = homicide_resolved:victim_sex)
  

glm_OR_CI = function(df) {
  
  fit_logistic = 
    glm(homicide_resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial())
  
  fit_logistic %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - (1.96 * std.error)),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + (1.96 * std.error))) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  select(OR, CI_lower, CI_upper) 
  
}


homicide_nest_df %>% 
  mutate(glm_output = map(data, glm_OR_CI)) %>% 
  unnest(glm_output) -> homicide_glm_df

## Plot

The code below creates a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for
each city. Cities are organized according to estimated OR:

``` r
homicide_glm_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, OR), y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper), width = 0.2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted OR for Solving Homicides Comparing Male to Female Victims",
    x = "City",
    y = "Adjusted OR Estimate")
```

![](p8105_hw6_sef2183_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

The city with the smallest adjusted OR estimate for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims is New York, NY. The confidence
interval range for this estimate is fairly small, ranging from about
0.14 to 0.50. The city with the largest adjusted OR estimate is
Albuquerque, NM. The confidence interval range for Albuquerque’s OR
estimate is much larger than New York, ranging from about 0.83 to 3.76.
A general trend that can observed from the plot is that the confidence
interval is wider as the estimated adjusted OR estimate increases.

# Problem 3

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset,
available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the
following variables:

babysex: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2) bhead: baby’s head
circumference at birth (centimeters) blength: baby’s length at birth
(centimeteres) bwt: baby’s birth weight (grams) delwt: mother’s weight
at delivery (pounds) fincome: family monthly income (in hundreds,
rounded) frace: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 =
Puerto Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown) gaweeks: gestational age in weeks
malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 = absent,
1 = present) menarche: mother’s age at menarche (years) mheigth:
mother’s height (inches) momage: mother’s age at delivery (years) mrace:
mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican, 8 =
Other) parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy pnumlbw:
previous number of low birth weight babies pnumgsa: number of prior
small for gestational age babies ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI ppwt:
mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds) smoken: average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy wtgain: mother’s weight gain
during pregnancy (pounds) Load and clean the data for regression
analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for
missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only):

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these:

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.
